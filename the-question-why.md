# The Question Why

ver 0.1 date: 2017-08-16

People search for the question why. It they want to spec out things. Specing
things out simplifies things. It reduces the amount of information you need to
understand something. The search for reasons why is a compression algorithm.

When one finds the reasons why, what is foggy becomes clear, and they become
happy. The clarity comes from being able to fit the whole thing in their head,
and it is like reaching the top of a mountain, now being able to see far in
every direction from a single vantage point.

Compression is not enough, however. You need to get the details back from the
reasons. In other words, decompression, in other words, deduction as opposed to
abduction.

These compression/decompresion, abduction/deduction, why/therefore, are all
different words for the same basic human imperative.

My childhood friend used to say, "Why ask why?". Now I have an answer -- we do
it to fit things in our heads. However, I know what he would have said next --
"Why do we fit things in our heads?".  I'll just cut to the chase here, the
power of reason is limited. The path you trace when you successively ask for
reasons ends in a place that is under-constrained.

To abduce the reason for some initial set of statements, one guesses the
reasons and tries to prove the initial statements. The first part is a heuristic,
and the second part is amenable to the concepts in automated theorem proving.
There is research on abduction, maybe I will write about it more in the future.


# Unfinished thoughts

Pentesting usually involves a complicated system and you want to abduce the
spec, so you guess a spec and then you also need to strategems for adbuction.
